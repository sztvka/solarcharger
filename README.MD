# SolarCharger
This project is my first shot at programming real-time systems featuring multiple tasks. I wanted to create a dual axis solar tracker with clean and reliable code in the field where most of the similar projects use poorly writen Arduino code.  
The device is able to:
- Track the sun in two axis
- Charge a battery
- Display a web UI displaying the current status of the device
